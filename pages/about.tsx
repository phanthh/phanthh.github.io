            Hi, I'm Hau - an asprising data scientist, web developer and Linux
            enthusiast. Solving problems and learning news thing about the
            world, especially technology and mathematics, are two of my
            dedicated life-long hobbies. Complexity intrigues me deeply and
            always make me motivated to understand it. At the moment, I am
            studying full time at{' '}

            and it has been a wonderful experience so far.

            I grew up in the sprawling city of Ho Chi Minh, graduated highschool
            majoring in mathematics. In 2019, I was lucky enough to become the
            valeditorian of the national college entrance exam in Vietnam and it
            is one of my proudest achievement.
          </p>

            Around this time, I also developed an interest in programming and
            technology, which leads me to study Computer Science and eventually
            Data science. After my first college year, I decided to pursue a
            degree abroad and to start all over again in the beautiful country
            of Finland.
